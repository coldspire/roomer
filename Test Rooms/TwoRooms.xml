                White room with black curtains.
            </simple>
            <detailed>
                This is a cube-shaped room with walls that are a bright flawless white. 
                There are tall black curtains hanging on and covering one side of the room. The curtains' contrast against the perfect white walls is almost grotesque.
                The curtains are drawn.

                        One side of the room has a short grey hallway leading into blackness.
                        Looking more closely, a soft light hints at the edges of another room within the nearly-flawless void.

                Black room with a window.
            </simple> 
            <detailed>
                This is a cube-shaped room with walls made from a deep impenetrable darkness.
                A clear window is stamped into one of the walls, providing a soft light that
                barely illuminates the room's opaque ceiling and walls.

                Sealed window with view of grassy plain.
            </simple>
            <detailed>
                The window has a frame of a dark polished wood, sectioning two clear panes of glass. The bottom section appears openable but won't budge, being either jammed or locked.
                Beyond the glass is a grassy plain with low rolling hills that extend to the horizon. The tall grass sways and bends beneath a light breeze, a wind unfelt to you within the sealed room.
                The sky is overcast, a grey blanket. On the horizon a thin rain curtain moves slowly across your view.
                Based on the intensity of the light outside, it could be either dusk or dawn.
                Some activity in the distance catches your eye: someone is slowly walking across the plain. Based on their meandering they appear to be looking for something within the waist-high grass.
